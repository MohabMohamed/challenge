# Challenge E

From the fact of the weight is equal for each pen per bucket, so the pen weight in the faulty bucket is 9g.

So the equation of the weight of all the buckets is (n-1)*100 + 90

So we could remove 1 pen from the first bucket, 2 from the second, 3 from the third and so on.

Then we scale all the buckets together.

so now the weight should equal ((n-1)*100 + 90 )- x , so if x = old_weight - 1 so there's only one light weight pen has been taken so the faulty bucket is the first one, if x = old_weight - 2  so there's two light weight pens have been taken
so  the faulty bucket is the second one. and so on.
